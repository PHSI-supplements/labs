\newcommand{\policyforcodethatdoesnotcompile}{\subsection*{Normally No Credit for Uncompilable Code}
    If the TA cannot create an executable from your code, then your code will be assumed to have no functionality.
    For most lab assignments, this would mean that you would earn very few, if any, points.\footnote{
        At the TA's discretion, if they can make your code compile with \textit{one} edit (such as introducing a missing semicolon) then they may do so and then assess a 10\% penalty on the resulting score.
        The TA is under no obligation to do so, and you should not rely on the TA's willingness to edit your code for grading.
        If there are multiple options for a single edit that would make your code compile, there is no guarantee that the TA will select the option that would maximize your score.
    }
    For \textit{this} lab assignment, you will still receive the credit you earned for attempting the assignment, even if it does not compile.
    Before turning in your code, be sure to compile and test your code on \runtimeenvironment\ without changing any files that you were instructed not to change.}
\newcommand{\latepolicy}{\subsection*{Late Submissions}
    This assignment is due before the start of your lab section.
     After you have exhausted your grace days, we will accept late turn-ins up to one hour late, assessing a 10\% penalty on these late submissions.
    After you have exhausted your grace days, any work turned in more than one hour late will not be graded.}
\newcommand{\softwareengineeringfrontmatter}{\section*{No Spaghetti Code Allowed}
        In the interest of keeping your code readable, you may \textit{not} use

        \lstinline{continue} statements, nor may you use any \lstinline{break}

    You're relaxing at your favorite hangout when another customer catches your attention.
    He's rather large (dare I say, \textit{mammoth}), a bit hairy, and looking frustrated in front of his laptop.
``I'm Archie,'' he says, ``and I'm trying to teach myself this card game called \textit{Poker}.
    I found this source code that I thought I could use to understand Poker better, but the code is incomplete, and I don't entirely understand what's there.
    Could you explain the code to me, please?''}
\newcommand{\scenariowrapup}{Archie's face lights up in a very big smile.
    ``Thanks!''
    After pausing in thought for a moment, he says, ``Say, I've got a new startup company that could really use your help.
    Are you interested?
    It'll be exciting!''}
