The purpose of this assignment is to (re)familiarize you with some aspects of C
that may not be intuitive to students who are new to C. Even if you know C,
work this assignment to re-familiarize yourself.

If you work faithfully at understanding the portions of code that you're
instructed to study, and if you work faithfully at writing the code you're
instructed to write you will receive credit for this assignment. The
instructions are written assuming you will edit and run the code on
\runtimeenvironment. If you wish, you may edit and run the code
in a different environment; be sure that your compiler suppresses no warnings,
and that if you are using an IDE that it is configured for C and not C++.

\section{Terminology}

The standard 52-card deck of ``French'' playing
cards\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck}}
consists of 52 cards. The cards are divided into 4 ``suits,'' clubs
($\clubsuit$), diamonds ($\diamondsuit$), hearts ($\heartsuit$), and spades
($\spadesuit$). Each suit consists of 13 cards: the number cards 2-10, the
``face cards'' (Jack, Queen, King), and the Ace. In most card games (including
Poker), the Jack is greater in value than the 10, the Queen is greater in value
than the Jack, and the King is greater in value than the Queen. In some games,
the Ace is lesser in value than the 2, in other games it is greater in value
than the King, and in some games, it can be either.

Poker\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker}} is a game of chance
and skill played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards, in which players
attempt to construct the best ``hand'' they can. While there are many
variations of the game, they all have this in common. A hand is a set of five
cards, and it can be categorized into types of hands (described on the third
page), which are ranked according to the statistical likelihood of being able
to construct such a hand. When completed, the code in this assignment will
generate a random hand and evaluate what type of hand it is.

\section{Getting Started}

Download \textit{\shortlabname.zip} or \textit{\shortlabname.tar} from
\filesource\ and copy it to \runtimeenvironment. Once copied, unzip the file.
The three source code files (\textit{card.h}, \textit{card.c},
\textit{poker.c}) contain the starter code for this assignment, and the text
file (\textit{answers.txt}) is where you'll provide some answers to demonstrate
your ability to understand part of the starter code. The header file
\textit{card.h} defines a ``card'' structure and specifies two functions that
operate on cards. The source file \textbf{card.c} has the bodies for the
specified functions, but some code is missing. Finally, the source file
\textit{poker.c} is supposed to generate a poker hand of five cards, print
those five cards, and then print what kind of hand it is -- but much of its
code is missing. To compile the program, type:

\texttt{gcc -std=c99 -Wall -o poker poker.c card.c}

If you compile the starter code, it may generate a warning:

\begin{verbatim}
card.c:59:30: warning: format string is empty [-Wformat-zero-length]
        sprintf(valueString, "", value);
                             ^~
\end{verbatim}

Before you make any other changes, you should edit \textit{card.c} so that the
program compiles without generating any warnings or errors. If you look at the
source code, you'll see a comment with instructions ``\texttt{PLACE THE CONTROL
STRING IN THE SECOND ARGUMENT THAT YOU WOULD USE TO PRINT AN INTEGER}.'' The
command \lstinline{sprintf()} is like \lstinline{printf()} and
\lstinline{fprintf()} except that it ``prints'' to a string. See $\S7.2$ of
\textit{The C Programming Language} on pages 153-155 for a description of
\lstinline{printf()} and \lstinline{sprintf()}, including some of the format
specifiers you can put in the format string.

If you also get a warning for an unused variable
\begin{verbatim}
poker.c:154:9: warning: unused variable ‘size_of_hand’ [-Wunused-variable]
     int size_of_hand = 5;
         ^
\end{verbatim}
then you can temporarily fix this warning by commenting-out the line
\lstinline{int size_of_hand = 5} in \textit{poker.c}'s \function{main()}
function.

\section{Completing \textit{card.c}}

Look over the rest of the code in \textit{card.c} and work at understanding
anything that you don't initially understand. When you have done so, add the
missing code to \function{create_card()} to populate a card's fields.
Finally, change the first two lines of \function{display_card()} so
that this function uses the fields from the card argument that is passed to the
function.

You may want to add a \function{main()} function to \textit{card.c} and compile
only \textit{card.c} to check that you made the correct changes. Catching
errors now will be easier than trying to catch them after you've started the
next task.

Examine the remaining starter code in \textit{poker.c} to make sure you
understand it.

\section{Completing \textit{poker.c}}

If you added a \function{main()} function to \textit{card.c}, remove it so that
there is only one \function{main()} function when you compile the full program.

In \textit{poker.c}, the first thing you'll want to do is write the code for
\function{populate_deck()}. Using \function{create_card()} from \textit{card.c},
create cards corresponding to the 52 standard playing cards and add them to the
\lstinline{deck[]} array. You might put code in \function{main()} to print out
all 52 cards in \lstinline{deck[]} using \function{display_card()}, to confirm
that you wrote \function{populate_deck()} correctly.

\subsection{Types of Poker Hands}

In the game of poker, hands are characterized by the similarities of the cards
within. Traditionally, you characterize the hand by the ``best''
characterization (that is, the one that is least likely to occur); for example,
a hand that is a three of a kind also contains a pair, but you would only
characterize the hand as a three of a kind. The \function{is...()} functions in
\textit{poker.c} are intentionally simple; they do not (and should not) check
whether there is a better way to characterize the hand. The types of hands
(from most desirable to least desirable) are:

\begin{description}
\item[Royal Flush] This is an Ace, a King, a Queen, a Jack, and a 10, all of
    the same suit. There is no function in the starter code for a royal flush,
    nor do you need to write one, since a royal flush is essentially the best-
    possible straight flush. (Note also that a Royal Flush is not possible for
    this lab, based on our re-definition of a Straight, below.)
\item[Straight Flush] This is five cards in a sequence, all of the same suit;
    that is, five cards that are both a straight and a flush. This
    characterization is checked by the function \function{is_straight_flush()}.
\item[Four of a Kind] Four cards all have the same value. This
    characterization is checked by the function \function{is_four_of_kind()}.
\item[Full House] The hand contains a three of a kind and also contains a pair
    with a different value than that of the first three cards. This
    characterization is checked by the function \function{is_full_house()}.
\item[Flush] Five cards all of the same suit. This characterization is checked
    by the function \function{is_flush()}. In the interest of simplicity, for
    this assignment we changed the definition of a flush to ``all cards are of
    the same suit'' (this distinction only matters if the number of cards in
    the hand is not five).
\item[Straight] Five cards in a sequence. This characterization is checked by
    the function \function{is_straight()}. In the interest of simplicity, for
    this assignment we changed the definition of a straight to ``all cards are
    in a sequence'' (this distinction only matters if the number of cards in
    the hand is not five). We further re-defined an Ace to be adjacent only to
    2 (in traditional poker, an Ace can be adjacent to 2 or to King but not
    both at the same time).
\item[Three of a Kind] Three cards all have the same value. This
    characterization is checked by the function \function{is_three_of_kind()}.
\item[Two Pair] The hand holds two different pairs. This characterization is
    checked by the function \function{is_two_pair()}.
\item[Pair] Two cards with the same value. This characterization is checked by
    the function \function{is_pair()}.
\item[High Card] If the hand cannot be better characterized, it is
    characterized by the greatest-value card in the hand. The starter code
    does not have a function to check for this since this is the
    characterization if all of the other functions return a \textbf{0}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Study the Code}
\label{studyTheCode}

Look at the code for \function{is_pair()}. Notice that the parameter
\lstinline{hand}'s type is \lstinline{card*}; that is, \lstinline{}{hand} is a
pointer to a \lstinline{}{card}. In the code, though, we treat
\lstinline{}{hand} as though it were an array. This is because in C, arrays are
pointers and we can treat pointers as arrays. Now look at the rest of the code
in \function{is_pair()}. Why does this return a \textbf{1} when the hand
contains at least one pair?  Why does it return a \textbf{0} when the hand
contains no pairs?  If you can't determine this on your own, you may talk it
over with other students or the TA. Type your answer in \textit{answers.txt}.

Look at the code for \function{is_flush()}. Why does this return a \textbf{1}
when all cards in the hand have the same suit?  Why does it return a \textbf{0}
when at least two cards have different suits?  If you can't determine this on
your own, you may talk it over with other students or the TA. Type your answer
in \textit{answers.txt}.

Look at the code for \function{is_straight()}. This is a little more challenging
to understand than \function{is_pair()} and \function{is_flush()}. Why does it
return a \textbf{1} when all cards in the hand are in sequence?  Why does it
return a \textbf{0} when they are not in sequence? If you can't determine this
on your own, you may talk it over with other students or the TA. Type your
answer in \textit{answers.txt}.

Look at the code for \function{is_two_pair()}. Recall that in C, arrays are
pointers. The assignment \lstinline{partial_hand = hand + i} makes use of
\textit{pointer arithmetic}. If the assignment were
\lstinline{partial_hand = hand} then it would assign \lstinline{hand}'s base
address to \lstinline{partial_hand}, and so \lstinline{partial_hand} would point
to the $0^{th}$ element of \lstinline{hand}. The expression $hand+i$ generates
the address for the $i^{th}$ element of \lstinline{}{hand}, and so
\lstinline{partial_hand = hand + i} assigns to \lstinline{partial_hand} the
address of the $i^{th}$ element of \lstinline{hand}. This effectively makes
\lstinline{partial_hand} an array such that
$\forall j : \mathtt{partial\_hand[j] = hand[i+j]}$.

Examine the remaining starter code in \textit{poker.c} to make sure you
understand it.

\subsection{Complete the code}

Write the code in \textit{poker.c}'s \function{main()} function to generate a
hand of five cards by calling \function{get_hand()}.\footnote{When you test the
other functions you need to write, you might want to temporarily bypass
\function{get_hand()} and explicitly assign specific cards to an array of five
\lstinline{card}s.}  (Uncomment the \lstinline{int size_of_hand = 5} line if you
previously commented it.)  Then have the program print out the five cards in
the hand. Finally, by calling the \function{is...()} functions, determine the
best-possible characterization of the hand and print out that information.

Now write the code for \function{is_three_of_kind()}, \function{is_full_house()}, and
\function{is_four_of_kind()}.
