You will now connect an external LED. An LED is a \textit{light emitting diode}, and like all diodes it allows current to flow only in one direction.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:led-annotated}, one lead on the LED is longer than the other, and this tells us which direction current will flow.
When we insert the LED into the circuit, power will flow from one of the \developmentboard's pins through the LED to ground.
Most LEDs have so little internal resistance that, unless current is otherwise limited, enough current will flow through the LED to destroy the semiconductor material.
The typical solution, which we will use, is to employ a \textit{current-limiting resistor}.
(If you look very closely at your \developmentboard, you will see a tiny surface-mount resistor next to each built-in LED.)

Figure~\ref{fig:led-diagram} shows a diagram of the components you will install for the LED output.

        the leads are flexible enough that you only need to be approximate) -- see Figure~\ref{fig:resistor-bent}.}
    \checkoffitem{Insert one of the resistor's leads into contact point \resistorcontactpointone\ (electrically connected to the \developmentboard's \ledpin\ pin in g1) and the other into contact point \resistorcontactpointtwo.}
    \checkoffitem{Gently press along the length of the resistor, causing the leads to deform slightly, until the resistor's height above the breadboard is about the same as the \developmentboard's printed circuit board.

    \checkoffitem{Take the LED and spread the leads apart slightly.}
    \checkoffitem{Insert the longer lead (the anode) in contact point \ledanodecontactpoint, and the shorter lead (the cathode) in the upper \ground.

When you have finished installing the external LED, there should be the electrical connections described in Table~\ref{tab:led}.
Read each of this and subsequent tables' rows as describing which electrical components are connected to which other components.
For example, the LED's anode is connected to the resistor's right lead;
the LED's cathode is connected to ground;
and the resistor's left lead is connected to the Arduino's ``\ledpin'' pin.

Now, instead of the built-in LED, the external LED that you installed will blink (Figure~\ref{fig:revisedblink}).
