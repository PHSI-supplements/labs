# KeyboardLab

This lab is designed to get students accustomed to thinking about data at the
bit-level.Somewhere between a third and a half of the students are able to 
complete this lab during lab time.

Students will have to use the ASCII table, should treat characters as integers
(though some students found ways to solve problem 2 that treats characters as
integer values but not as arithmetic operands), will treat integers as an
arrangement of bits, and will learn to use bit masks, bit shifts, and bitwise
AND & OR.

Students should also gain more confidence in their ability to use C -- there
really aren't any C quirks here other than being able to treat characters as
integers.

I include a *Jurassic Park* meme ("Spares no expense / Hires on I.T. guy") when
I assign this lab. You can easily find the one I use or a similar one ("Hires
one coder to debug 2,000,000 lines of code") with [an internet
search](https://www.google.com/search?q=spares+no+expense+hires+one+it+guy&tbm=isch). If you don't want to
include the meme, then comment-out these lines:
```
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.33\textwidth}

    \includegraphics[scale=.33]{some-expenses-spared}
    \caption{Some expenses were spared.}
\end{wrapfigure}
