If you are re-using a class kit from Fall 2021, make the following modifications
to your class kit.


1. Remove the wire that connects contact point e31 to the upper power (+) rail.
Remove the wire that connects contact point e36 to the upper power (+) rail.

2. If you had to remove any other wires for step 1, return those wires to their
original positions.

CHECKPOINT: Verify that
        - Left switch's left pin is pulled low (no change)
        - Left switch's center pin is connected to Arduino Nano's A4 pin (no change)
        - Left switch's right pin is not connected to anything (this is a change from Fall 2021)
        - Right switch's left pin is pulled low (no change)
        - Right switch's center pin is connected to Arduino nano's A5 pin (no change)
        - Right switch's right pin is not connected to anything (this is a change from Fall 2021)
        - Left pushbutton's left lead is connected to a lower NAND input and to the Arduino Nano's D8 pin (no change)
        - Left pushbutton's right lead is pulled low (no change)
        - Right pushbutton's left lead is connected to a lower NAND input and to the Arduino Nano's D9 pin (no change)
        - Right pushbutton's right lead is pulled low (no change)

3. AFTER you have had your wiring checked, download the *new* InputTest.ino
from Canvas.

4. Connect your Arduino Nano to the computer. Compile the *new* InputTest.ino
and upload it to your Arduino Nano.

5. Open the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor, and then manipulate the switches to
confirm that
    - Each switch's value is 0 when in the left position, and its value is 1 when in the right position
    - Each button's value is 1 when not pressed, and its value is 0 when pressed
    - The Button NAND is normally 0 but becomes 1 when either button is pressed
    - Each of the 16 keys on the matrix keypad produces the expected effect

 6. Compile OutputTest.ino, upload it to your Arduino Nano, and confirm that
 your display module still functions correctly.

 7. Compile your MyBlink.ino that you prepared in Fall 2021 (or create a new
 MyBlink.ino using the kit's assembly instructions), upload it to your Arduino
 Nano, and confirm that your external LED still functions correctly (recall
 that you may have to shade the LED with your hand to see it turning on and
 off).
