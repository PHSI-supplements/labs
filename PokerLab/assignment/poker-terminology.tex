The standard 52-card deck of ``French'' playing cards\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck}} consists of 52 cards.
The cards are divided into 4 ``suits,'' clubs ($\clubsuit$), diamonds ($\diamondsuit$), hearts ($\heartsuit$), and spades ($\spadesuit$).
Each suit consists of 13 cards: the number cards 2--10, the ``face cards'' (Jack, Queen, King), and the Ace.
In most card games (including Poker), the Jack is greater in value than the 10, the Queen is greater in value than the Jack, and the King is greater in value than the Queen.
In some games, the Ace is lesser in value than the 2, in other games it is greater in value than the King, and in some games, it can be either.

Poker\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker}} is a game of chance and skill played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards, in which players attempt to construct the best ``hand'' they can.
While there are many variations of the game, they all have this in common.
A hand is a set of five cards, and it can be categorized into types of hands (described in Section~\ref{subsec:typesofpokerhands}), which are ranked according to the statistical likelihood of being able to construct such a hand.
When completed, the code in this assignment will generate a random hand and evaluate what type of hand it is.
