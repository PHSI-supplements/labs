Look over the rest of the code in \textit{card.c} and work at understanding anything that you don't initially understand.
When you have done so, add the missing code to \function{create_card()} to populate a card's fields.
Finally, change the first two lines of \function{display_card()} so that this function uses the fields from the card argument that is passed to the function.

You will receive half-credit for \function{create_card()} and \function{display_card()} if you make a good-faith effort at implementing these functions as specified.
You will receive full credit for these functions if you implement them correctly.

You may want to add a \function{main()} function to \textit{card.c} and compile only \textit{card.c} to check that you made the correct changes.
Catching errors now will be easier than trying to catch them after you've started the next task.

Examine the remaining starter code in \textit{poker.c} to make sure you understand it.
