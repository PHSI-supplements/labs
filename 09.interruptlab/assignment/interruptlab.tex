The instructions are written assuming you will edit the code in the Arduino IDE
and run it on \runtimeenvironment, constructed according to the pre-lab
instructions. If you wish, you may edit the code in a different environment;
however, our ability to provide support for problems with other IDEs is limited.

Please familiarize yourself with the entire assignment before beginning.

\section{Scenario}

Smoke wafts from Herb's soldering iron as he looks up when you approach.
Cleaning the iron's tip, he quotes: ``Somebody once said, `The three most
dangerous things in the world are a programmer with a soldering iron, a
hardware engineer with a software patch, and'{}'' -- he glances nervously in
Archie's direction -- ``{}`a user with an idea.'\footnote{Rick Cook, \textit{The
Wizardry Consulted}, 1995.}$^{\mathrm{,}}$\footnote{The notion of being wary of
programmers wielding screwdrivers, soldering irons long pre-dated this quote,
as there are apocryphal tales of people who found it easier to modify the
hardware to suit the software rather than the other way around.}'' Herb gets
straight to the point. ``We promised Archie that we'd be able to start using
the Cow Pi to build systems in a week. So far we've tested its input/output
functionality, but we still need to test its timer and also whether we can take
inputs without constantly polling the input devices. As before, we don't need
to do anything too fancy; let's try a number base conversion tool.''

\section{Number-Base Conversion Tool Specification} \label{sec:FunctionalSpecification}

\dots

\section{Constraints}\label{sec:Constraints}

You may continue to use the memory-mapped I/O registers, or you can use
functions provided by the Arduino core read from and write to pins.

You may re-use code from the previous lab, or you can rewrite the necessary
code using functions, macros, types, or constants that are part of the Arduino
core;\footnote{\url{https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/}} functions, macros,
types, or constants of
avr-libc;\footnote{\url{https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/index.html}}
or one of Arduino's standard
libraries.\footnote{\url{https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/} The
standard libraries are those under the heading, ``Standard Libraries.''} You
may \textit{not} use a third-party library, not even one that the Arduino
Libraries reference page links to (if it isn't among those available in the
Arudino IDE's ``Sketch'' $\rightarrow$ ``Include Library'' menu under
``Arduino libraries'' then you may not use it).

You may \textit{not} poll the matrix keypad nor the pushbuttons to determine
if they have been pressed. You must use interrupts to determine if a key or
button has been pressed. Once a press has been detected, you may scan the
matrix keypad or read the pushbuttons to determine which key or button has
been pressed.

You may poll the switches to determine if either's position has changed;
however, the specification has been written such that your code should only
need to occasionally check the switches' positions rather than polling them for
changes.

While it is possible to configure the SPI hardware to generate an interrupt
after the content of the SPI Data Register is transmitted, you may use your
\function{send_data()} function that polls the \texttt{SPIF} bit.

While you may use \function{millis()} for debouncing, you may \textit{not} use
\function{millis()} nor \function{micros()} to implement the display timeout.
You must use an interrupt from the ATmega328P's Timer1 or Timer2 as part of
implementing the display timeout.

\section{Getting Started} \label{sec:GettingStarted}

\dots

\section{Implementing Timeout}\label{sec:TimerInterrupts}

You must use timer interrupts from either Timer1 or Timer2 as part of your
implementation of the display timeout. Without using an external clock source,
you won't be able to configure an interrupt to occur every 30 seconds, or even
every 7.5 seconds. Since we will not use an external clock source, you will need
to use timer interrupts along with other logic.

\subsection{Preparation}

Design your logic and determine how often you need a timer interrupt to make it
work. For example, the \nano's pseudorealtime clock relies on an interrupt from
Timer0 every 1.024µs and advances the millisecond counter after 1,000 of these
interrupts have occurred. The pseudorealtime clock uses an overflow-based timer
interrupt to arrive at an approximation of milliseconds. The calculator's
specification calls for the display module going black exactly 7.5 seconds or
exactly 30 seconds (depending on the switch position) after the last key press
or button press. To achieve exactness, you will use a comparison-based timer.

You can then determine the parameters for the timer using
this equation:
\[
16,000,000 \frac{\mathrm{cycles}}{\mathrm{second}} =
    comparison\_value \frac{\mathrm{beats}}{\mathrm{interrupt}} \times
    prescaler \frac{\mathrm{cycles}}{\mathrm{beat}} \times
    interrupt\_frequency \frac{\mathrm{interrupts}}{\mathrm{second}}
\]
or, equivalently:
\[
    comparison\_value \frac{\mathrm{beats}}{\mathrm{interrupt}} \times
    prescaler \frac{\mathrm{cycles}}{\mathrm{beat}} =
    16,000,000 \frac{\mathrm{cycles}}{\mathrm{second}} \times
    interrupt\_period \frac{\mathrm{seconds}}{\mathrm{interrupt}}
\]
where:
    \begin{description}
    \item [16,000,000 Hz] is the clock frequency (the inverse of the clock
        period).
    \item [comparison\_value] is a number you will place in one of the
        timer's \texttt{compare} registers for a comparison-based timer
        interrupt. This can be any possible value of an unsigned 16-bit integer
        for Timer1, or any possible value of an unsigned 8-bit integer for
        Timer2.
    \item [prescaler] is a multiplier applied to the clock period to adjust the
        time between counter increments (``beats''). Possible values are 1, 8,
        64, 256, and 1024 for Timer1, or 1, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 1024 for
        Timer2.
    \item [interrupt\_frequency] is how often you want a timer interrupt (the
        inverse of the interrupt period).
    \item [interrupt\_period] is the time between timer interrupts (the
        inverse of the interrupt frequency).
    \end{description}

You may have to iterate on your design until you arrive at one that works with
the constraints of that equation's terms for whichever timer you choose to use.

The Waveform Generation Mode you will use is \textit{CTC} (Clear Timer on
Compare) with the ``TOP'' value set by the \texttt{OCRnA} (\textit{compareA})
register, where $n$ is the Timer number. Use Figure~\ref{fig:Timer1WGM} (for
Timer1) or Figure~\ref{fig:Timer2WGM} (for Timer2) to select the appropriate
\texttt{WGM13}~\texttt{WGM12}~\texttt{WGM11}~\texttt{WGM10} or
\texttt{WGM22}~\texttt{WGM21}~\texttt{WGM20} bits.

Based on the prescaler you chose for the above equation, select the appropriate
\texttt{CS12}~\texttt{CS11}~\texttt{CS10} or
\texttt{CS22}~\texttt{CS20}~\texttt{CS20} bits from Figure~\ref{fig:Timer1CS}
(for Timer1) or Figure~\ref{fig:Timer2CS}) (for Timer2).

\subsection{Setup}

In the \function{setup()} function or a function called by \function{setup()}:

You may configure the timer using either memory-mapped I/O or using macros
provided by AVR-libc.\footnote{AVR-libc provides macros named after the I/O
registers that allow you to read from and write to these registers as though
they were ordinary variables.} If using memory-mapped I/O:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Timer1, create a pointer to a
    \lstinline{struct timer_registers_16bit} and assign to it the address
    \lstinline{IObase + 0x60}.
\item For Timer2, create a pointer to a
    \lstinline{struct timer_registers_8bit} and assign to it the address
    \lstinline{IObase + 0x90}.
\item Use the struct's \lstinline{control} field to set the \texttt{WGM} and
    \texttt{CS} bits in the timer's control registers.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use Tables~\ref{table:Timer1Registers} and \ref{table:Timer1Control}
        (for Timer1) or Tables~\ref{table:Timer2Registers} and
        \ref{table:Timer2Control} (for Timer2) to determine where the
        \texttt{WGM} and \texttt{CS} bits are located in the control registers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If using AVR-libc macros:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Timer1, make assignments to \lstinline{TCCR1A} and/or
    \lstinline{TCCR1B}.
\item For Timer2, make assignments to \lstinline{TCCR2A} and/or
    \lstinline{TCCR2B}.
\item Use Table~\ref{table:Timer1Control} (for Timer1)
    Table~\ref{table:Timer2Control} (for Timer2) to determine where the
    \texttt{WGM} and \texttt{CS} bits are located in the control registers.
\end{itemize}

Next assign your computed $comparison\_value$ the struct's \lstinline{compareA}
field, or to OCR1A (Timer1) or OCR2A (Timer2), as appropriate.

Finally, enable the comparison-based timer interrupt. If you are using
memory-mapped I/O:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a pointer to a \lstinline{volatile uint8_t} and assign to it the
    address \lstinline{IObase + 0x4E}.
\item Treat the pointer as an array, and use the timer number (1 or 2) for the
    index when making an assignment.
\end{itemize}
If you are using AVR-libc macros:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make an assignment to \texttt{TIMSK1} for Timer1, or to \texttt{TIMSK2}
    for Timer2.
\end{itemize}

You want to place a 1 in the \texttt{OCIEnA} bit (where $n$ is the timer
number); use Figure~\ref{fig:TimerInterruptRegisters} to determine the
appropriate bit to set.

    \caption{Timer interrupt registers. \tiny Cropped from ATmega382P Data Sheet, §30 \label{fig:TimerInterruptRegisters}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Interrupt Service Routine}

Because the Arduino core does not provide a more convenient way to create an
interrupt service routine (ISR) for timer interrupts, you will use AVR-libc's
\function{ISR}\footnote{\url{https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html}}
macro.

In \textit{CalculatorLab.ino}, outside of any other function, write this code that looks like a function:

\begin{lstlisting}
ISR(vector) {
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

where $vector$ is \lstinline{TIMER1_COMPA_vect} for Timer1 or
\lstinline{TIMER2_COMPA_vect} for Timer2. Replace ``\dots'' with the code that
should execute whenever the timer interrupt occurs. You want to keep your ISR
short, no more than a few lines of code. If anything more elaborate needs to
happen, code in your \function{loop()} function (or a function called by
\function{loop()}) can do that based on changes made from within your ISR.

Initially, you may want to simply place a \function{println} statement in your
ISR code to verify that you have the timing correct. Once you are satisfied
that you have done so, remove the \function{println} statement and add the code
you need for your logic.

\textbf{NOTE} Any global variables used by your ISR should be declared as \lstinline{volatile}.

\textbf{NOTE} If you ever need to ``reset'' a timer's count back to 0, you can
simply write 0 to the structs \lstinline{counter} field or to
\texttt{TCNT1}/\texttt{TCNT2}.

\section*{Appendix: Lab Checkoff}

You are not required to have your assignment checked-off by a TA or the
professor. If you do not do so, then we will perform a functional check
ourselves. In the interest of making grading go faster, we are offering a small
bonus to get your assignment checked-off at the start of your scheduled lab
time immediately after it is due. Because checking off all students during lab
would take up most of the lab time, we are offering a slightly larger bonus if
you complete your assignment early and get it checked-off by a TA or the
professor during office hours.
