# Memory Measurement Lab

[//]: # (MemoryLab © 2021-25 Christopher A. Bohn)

In this assignment, you will measure the speed of different memories and draw conclusions based on your understanding of memory hierarchies.
**You will be able to complete this lab assignment during lab time.**

This assignment is worth 10 points.

## Front Matter

### Submission Deadline

This assignment is due **the week of December 8, before the end of your lab section**.
*You must complete this lab assignment during lab time*;
it is due at the end of your scheduled lab session.

<font color="red">After you have finished this assignment, take your Cow Pi kit to Avery 27 to return it.</font>

### Collaboration Rules

This is an individual-effort project.
If necessary, you may get help from another student to collect data. 
You may discuss the nature of memory technologies and of memory hierarchies with classmates,
but you must draw your own conclusions.

### Generative AI Rules

You may use the CodeHelp.app "virtual TA" for help, and
you may use "Oscar the AI Tutor" built into the course's textbook.
You may use other generative AI tools to translate this assignment into another human language.
No other use of generative AI is permitted on this assignment without explicit permission from Dr. Bohn.
