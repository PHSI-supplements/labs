## Getting Started

> 📇 **Mid-Credits Scene**
> 
> Herb walks up to you.
> "Could you do me a favor, please?
> I'd like to better characterize some of the performance characteristics of the Cow Pi,
> but I don't have the time to do so.
> Now that the urgency over developing the security systems is behind us,
> I need to get back to Eclectic Electronics to clean up a couple of messes that I had to leave there while we developed the Cow Pi.
> Do you mind measuring the memory performance?"


### Configuring the Project

> ❗️ **Important**
> 
> These instructions differ from what you used for other assignments.
> Be sure to read them.

#### From VS Code

- [ ] Start your IDE.
- [ ] Launch the PlatformIO plugin.
- [ ] Depending on your particular IDE and plugin version, look for a button to "Pick a Folder", "Open Project", or something similar.
- [ ] Click on that button and navigate to the MemoryLab project.
- [ ] Build the project.
  - There are many parts of MBED&nbsp;OS that generate compiler warnings.
    By building the project now, before you've written any of your own code, you're assured that any compiler warnings that you see in the future will be warnings about *your* code.

#### From the Command Line

- [ ] Use the `cd` command to navigate to the MemoryLab directory
- [ ] Build the project using the command
  ```shell
  pio run
  ```
  - There are many parts of MBED&nbsp;OS that generate compiler warnings.
    By building the project now, before you've written any of your own code, you're assured that any compiler warnings that you see in the future will be warnings about *your* code.


### Getting/Offering Help for Collecting Data

If you forgot to bring your Cow&nbsp;Pi to lab,then you will need to work with someone else to collect data.
*You may work with another student to collect data, and you may discuss the nature of memory technologies and of memory hierarchies with other students,
but **you must draw your own conclusions.***
