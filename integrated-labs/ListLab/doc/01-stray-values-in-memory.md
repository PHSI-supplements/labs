### Pleistocene Petting Zoo Marquee

> Archie shows you his first program, which he hoped would be used to greet guests, but it doesn‚Äôt always work right:
> ```c

>  6.  **    Get ready for hands-on excitement on the count of three! 1.. 2.. 3..
>  7.  **    Have fun!
>  8.  *  With brief pauses during the "Get ready" line.
>  9.  ***********************************************************************/

> 34.     splash_screen();
> 35.     count();

> Sometimes the output was what he expected:

What mistake did Archie make?
Why does `*sum` have the value 6 on line 25?
Why does `*sum - *product` produce the value 0?
Without changing the function signatures, how can Archie's code be fixed?
