## Encoding Numbers into the IEEE 754 Format

### TL;DR

In the `encode()` function:
- [ ] Determine whether the value is too great to be represented as a normal number.
- [ ] Determine whether the value is too small to be represented as a normal number.
- [ ] If the number can be represented as a normal number, then encode `number` in the IEEE&nbsp;754 normal form.
- [ ] If the number is too small to be represented as a normal number, then:
  - [ ] Use `unnormal_t`'s `set_exponent()` function to set `number`'s exponent to that which all 32-bit subnormal numbers have, and
  - [ ] Encode `number` in the IEEE&nbsp;754 subnormal form.
- [ ] Appropriately encode numbers too great to be represented as normal numbers.
- [ ] Compile and run *floatlab*, recoding a few values (example usages: <u>`recode 12.375`</u> and <u>`recode 0x00055000`</u>).


### Encoding Numbers

The `encode()` function converts an `unnormal_t` value into an IEEE&nbsp;754-compliant format.
The function stub already handles zero and the flagged cases of Not-a-Number and Infinity.
The stub also handles the sign bit.

Observe that when your program reaches
```c
/* GENERATE THE APPROPRIATE BIT VECTOR AND PLACE IT IN RESULT */
```
then you know that `number`'s "true value" is a non-zero, finite number.
Moreover, the integer portion has been set to $1$, which will make it easy to determine if `number` can be encoded as a normal number,
and will make it easy to perform that encoding.

In the `encode()` function:
- [ ] Determine whether the value is too great to be represented as a normal number.

  > Is `number`'s exponent greater than that?
- [ ] Determine whether the value is too small to be represented as a normal number.

  > Is `number`'s exponent less than that?
- [ ] If the number can be represented as a normal number, then encode `number` in the IEEE&nbsp;754 normal form.
- [ ] If the number is too small to be represented as a normal number, then:
    - [ ] Use `unnormal_t`'s `set_exponent()` function to set `number`'s exponent to that which all 32-bit subnormal numbers have, and
    - [ ] Encode `number` in the IEEE&nbsp;754 subnormal form.

For both normal and subnormal numbers, you will need to use `unnormal_t`'s functions that access the structure's fields.
Don't forget that the bit vector returned by `get_unnormal_fraction()` is the numerator of $\frac{get\_unnormal\_fraction()}{2^{64}}$ and that `get_unnormal_exponent()` returns the two's complement representation of the exponent.

Overflowing numbers too great to be represented as normal numbers, and underflowing numbers too small to be represented as subnormal numbers can be implemented now, but you will not be able to test them until you have implemented some arithmetic.
- [ ] Appropriately encode numbers too great to be represented as normal numbers.
- Encoding numbers that are too small to be represented as subnormal numbers requires no special treatment -- it should be handled as a natural consequence of adjusting the `number` to be able to properly encode it as a subnormal number.


#### Check Your Work

When you run *floatlab*, you can specify that you want to recode a value, such as <u>`recode 12.375`</u>.
The program will first decode the value.
Then it will send the result to `encode()`.
Finally, it will print the original value and the `ieee754_t` value returned by `encode`.

- [ ] Compile and run *floatlab*, recoding a few values.

For example:
```
Enter ... "recode <value>",
    or "quit": recode 12.375
expected: 12.3750000000_{10}	0x41460000	+1.1000,1100,0000,0000,0000,000_{2} x 2^{3}
actual:   12.3750000000_{10}	0x41460000	+1.1000,1100,0000,0000,0000,000_{2} x 2^{3}

Enter ... "recode <value>",
    or "quit": recode 0x00055000
expected: 0.0000000000_{10}	0x00055000	+0.0000,1010,1010,0000,0000,000_{2} x 2^{-126}
actual:   0.0000000000_{10}	0x00055000	+0.0000,1010,1010,0000,0000,000_{2} x 2^{-126}
```

Try some other numbers to check that your `encode()` function correctly encodes the value that's in an `unnormal_t` data structure.
