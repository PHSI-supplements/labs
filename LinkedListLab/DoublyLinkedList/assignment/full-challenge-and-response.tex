You plug in your shiny, new keyboard, tune your satellite radio to the Greatest Hits of the 1920s, and settle in to solving a more interesting problem.

To protect against corporate espionage, you are responsible for writing code for a challenge-and-response system.
Anybody can challenge anyone else in the Pleistocene Petting Zoo's non-public areas by providing the name of a book and a word contained within the book, and the person being challenged must respond with another word from that book, based on certain rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All of the book's words are sorted alphabetically without regard to capitalization (for example, ``hello'' occurs after ``Hear'' and before ``HELP'')
    \item The challenge word occurs \textit{occurrences} times in the book
    \item If \textit{occurrences} is an even number then the response word is the word \textit{occurrences} places \textbf{before} the challenge word in the alphabetized list;
        if the challenge word is less than \textit{occurrences} places from the start of the list then the response word is the first word in the list
    \item If \textit{occurrences} is an odd number then the response word is the word \textit{occurrences} places \textbf{after} the challenge word in the alphabetized list;
        if the challenge word is less than \textit{occurrences} places from the end of the list then the response word is the last word in the list
\end{itemize}

Here is a simple example.
Suppose the words in the specified book are:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
        \textit{word} & \textit{occurrences} \\ \hline
        apple       & 7 \\
        banana      & 4 \\
        carrot      & 15 \\
        date        & 3 \\
        eggplant    & 2 \\
        fig         & 6 \\
        granola     & 9 \\
        horseradish & 9 \\
        ice         & 6 \\
        jelly       & 3 \\
        kale        & 1 \\
        lemon       & 2 \\
        mango       & 8 \\
        naan        & 7 \\
        orange      & 5 \\
        pineapple   & 1 \\
        quinoa      & 11 \\
        raisin      & 4 \\
        spaghetti   & 10 \\
        tomato      & 12 \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
If the challenge word is ``horseradish'' then because horseradish occurs 9 times in the book, the response word is ``quinoa,'' which is 9 places in the list after ``horseradish.''
If the challenge word is ``eggplant'' then the response is ``carrot,'' which is 2 places earlier in the list than ``eggplant.''
If the challenge word is ``banana'' then the response word is ``apple,'' which is the first word in the list.
If the challenge word is ``quinoa'' then the response word is ``tomato,'' the last word in the list.

You break the problem down into four sub-problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Designing the Data Structure and Its Algorithms
    \item Alphabetizing Words
    \item Inserting Words
    \item Responding to a Challenge
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{The Books}

Four small ``books'' are included with the starter code:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Animals'' (sorted, 7 words)
    \item ``Plants'' (unsorted, 7 words)
    \item ``Cars'' (sorted, 74 words)
    \item ``Food'' (unsorted, 125 words)
\end{itemize}

Two real books have also been reduced to one word per line:\footnote{The text for these books was obtained from \href{https://www.gutenberg.org/}{Project Gutenberg}.
In accordance with Paragraph~1.C of the \href{https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/license}{Project Gutenberg License}, all references to Project Gutenberg have been removed from the ``derived works'' that we are distributing.
(Removing the references to Project Gutenberg was also necessary to ensure that \textit{only} the words from the books are used for the challenge-and-response system.)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mary Shelly's \textit{Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus} (filename ``Frankenstein'') \url{https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84} (sorted; 74,363 words)
    \item Arthur Conan Doyle's \textit{The Lost World} (filename ``TheLostWorld'')
    \url{https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139} (unsorted; 77,268 words)
\end{itemize}

The very small files of 7 words can be useful for debugging, and the moderate-sized files of 74--125 words should give you confidence in the correctness of your solution.
The real books of more than 74,000 words will be used for grading (as will smaller problem instances).
The files marked as \textit{sorted} have all of their words already in alphabetically sorted order, ignoring capitalization;
the files marked as \textit{unsorted} do not have their words sorted (the words in ``Plants'' and ``Food'' are in a randomly-selected order;
the words in ``TheLostWorld'' appear in the order that they appear in the original \textit{The Lost World}).

Each book file, ``\textit{file}'', has a corresponding ``\textit{file}-table.md'' that contains a Markdown-formatted table of the challenge words, the number of occurrences for each challenge word, and the corresponding response word.
You may use these files to confirm the correctness of your solution.

Throughout the assignment, we note that if building the list takes more than a few seconds, there is a bug in your code;
for context, we can build the list for \textit{Frankenstein} in under 1.9 seconds and the list for \textit{The Lost World} in under 2.4 seconds.
We can locate a word (or determine the absence of a word) in the \textit{Frankenstein} list in under 0.5ms and in the \textit{The Lost World} list in under 0.9ms.

\subsection{Preparation}

Copy your files \textit{problem2.c} and \textit{problem3.c} from KeyboardLab into the directory that has \textit{pointerlab.c} and \textit{challenge-response.c}.
If you did not successfully complete KeyboardLab, we will provide alternate implementations for you.

\subsection{Designing the Data Structure and Its Algorithms, part 1}

You decide that a linked list is the best data structure option for the challenge-and-response system.
You probably learned about linked lists in \cstwo; however, we will provide a refresher.

\subsubsection{Singly-Linked List} \label{subsubsec:singlylinkedlist}

For now, you will design a linked list that will work for challenge words with an odd numbers of occurrences;
that is, challenge words whose response word is later in the list than the challenge word.

A \textit{linked list} is linear collection of data.
Like an array, each element (or \textit{node}) has a particular position in the list, and when you iterate over the list, you always access the elements in the same order every time (unless you change or re-order the elements).

In an array, the elements are contiguous in memory, and you can access a specific element by indexing the array (or, equivalently, performing pointer arithmetic).
In a linked list, however, the nodes can be in arbitrary locations in memory, and the nodes are connected by references (in C, pointers).
You can access a specific element only by following pointers from one node to the next until you reach the desired node.

The simplest linked list is a \textit{singly-linked list}.
A node consists of a \textit{payload} (the data that we care about) and a reference to the \textit{next} node.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{singly-linked-list}
    \caption{Nodes in a singly-linked list consist of the payload data and a reference that points to the next node.}
\end{figure}

A linked list's greatest advantage over an array is that inserting and removing a node at an arbitrary location takes constant time, whereas inserting an element into an array (assuming there is sufficient memory allocated for the array) or removing an element from an array requires moving all the elements that follow the element's index.
Inserting a new node, $C$ between adjacent nodes $A$ and $B$ (where $B = A.next$) requires connecting $C.next$ to $B$ and re-assigning $A.next$ to $C$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{sll-insertion}
    \caption{Inserting a new node into a singly-linked list only requires assignments to the affected \textit{next} pointers.}
\end{figure}

As with an array, you do need to maintain a variable that points to the list.
Conventionally, this is a reference to the \textit{head} of the list. (Note that if a new node is inserted before the current head node, then the new node becomes the head of the list, and your \lstinline{head} variable would need to be updated.)
It is not uncommon to also maintain a reference to the \textit{tail} of the list.

\subsubsection{Equivalent Java Code}

In Java, you probably wouldn't implement your own linked list;
instead, you would use \lstinline{java.util.LinkedList}, which has been available since J2SE~1.2.
A list of hypothetical \lstinline{Payload} objects would be created with:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
    List<Payload> payloads = new LinkedList<>;
\end{lstlisting}

C doesn't have a built-in linked list data type, so you will need to design one.
Let us consider what a custom linked list would look like in Java.

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
public class Node {
    private final String word;          $\label{code:javaWord}$
    private int occurrences;            $\label{code:javaOccurrences}$
    private Node next;                  $\label{code:javaNext}$
    private Node previous;              $\label{code:javaPrevious}$

    public Node(String word) {$\lstsetnumber{\ldots}$
        ...$\lstresetnumber\setcounter{lstnumber}{11}$
    }

    public void insertAfter(Node existingNode) {$\lstsetnumber{\ldots}$
        ...$\lstresetnumber\setcounter{lstnumber}{22}$
    }

    public void insertBefore(Node existingNode) {$\lstsetnumber{\ldots}$
        ...$\lstresetnumber\setcounter{lstnumber}{33}$
    }$\lstsetnumber{\ldots}$
    ...$\lstresetnumber\setcounter{lstnumber}{98}$
}
\end{lstlisting}

Creating and inserting a new node would look something like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=200, mathescape=true]
    Node node = new Node("eggplant");   $\label{code:newNode}$
    Node otherNode = ... // code to determine where the new node goes
    node.insertAfter(otherNode);        $\label{code:javaInsertAfter}$
\end{lstlisting}

Recall that in Java, all variables except primitive types (such as \lstinline{occurrences} on line~\ref{code:javaOccurrences}) are references.
This means that the \lstinline{next} field on line~\ref{code:javaNext} is a reference to another Node, just as we described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:singlylinkedlist}.
The payload is the \lstinline{word} and how many \lstinline{occurrences} the word has, exactly what we need for the challenge-and-response system.

Recall also that in Java, the \lstinline{new} keyword allocates space for the new object, and the constructor call -- \lstinline{Node("eggplant")} -- initializes the object.

\subsubsection{C Implementation}

In \textit{challenge-response.h}, you'll see a \lstinline{struct} with the same fields as our Java example:

\lstinputlisting[linerange=19-24, firstnumber=36]{../starter-code/challenge-response.h}

In \textit{challenge-response.c}, you'll also see the \function{create_node()} function:

\lstinputlisting[linerange=23-29, firstnumber=23]{../starter-code/challenge-response.c}

As you can see, it allocates space for a new node using \function{malloc()}.
The code that you will need to add to it will copy the \lstinline{word} argument into the \lstinline{word} field and set an appropriate initial value for the \lstinline{occurrences} field.
Since we don't yet know where this node will go, set the \lstinline{next} and \lstinline{previous} pointers to \lstinline{NULL}.

The other function you need to write now is \function{insert_after()}:

\lstinputlisting[linerange=31-36, firstnumber=31]{../starter-code/challenge-response.c}

As the name and documentation indicate, you need to add code that will update the nodes' \lstinline{next} pointers so that \lstinline{new_node} is placed in the list immediately after \lstinline{existing_node}.
For now, you can ignore the \lstinline{previous} pointers.

After you have implemented \function{create_node()} and \function{insert_after()}, go to the \function{main()} function in \textit{pointerlab.c} and un-comment the call to \function{test_linked_list_functions()}.

\lstinputlisting[linerange=54-55, firstnumber=54]{../starter-code/pointerlab.c}

Build the executable with the command: \texttt{make pointerlab}.
Be sure to fix both errors and warnings.
When the program compiles without generating any warnings or errors, run it.
The output should indicate a list with the nodes in the order of ``first node,'' ``fourth node,'' ``second node,'' and ``third node.''

\subsection{Alphabetize Words}

In KeyboardLab Problem~2, you wrote code to convert uppercase letters to lowercase letters.
Add code to \function{word_to_lowercase()} that calls that function to convert all letters in a word to lowercase letters.
\textbf{(Do not copy the \function{to_lowercase()} function into \textit{challenge-response.c};
we will link to the function in \textit{problem2.c})}.

\lstinputlisting[linerange=48-62, firstnumber=48]{../starter-code/challenge-response.c}

The starter code includes a function to compare two words (you do not need to write this function) but it assumes that both words are completely lowercase.

If you did not complete KeyboardLab, then place this code in your \textit{problem2.c} file:

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <ctype.h>

char decapitalize(char character) {
    return tolower(character);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Inserting Words, part 1}

Comment-out (or delete) the call to \function{test_linked_list_functions()}.

For this sub-problem, the user will be prompted to enter the name of a book, which will be the filename of a file that contains all of the book's words.
All punctuation has already been removed from the files, and each line in the file contains exactly one word.
For now, you will design the code to work with files whose contents are already sorted.

\lstinputlisting[linerange=67-88, firstnumber=67]{../starter-code/challenge-response.c}

Add code to \function{insert_word()} and \function{build_list()} to read the specified file one line at a time.\footnote{See \S7.5 and \S{}B1.1.1 of Kernighan \& Ritchie's \textit{The C Programming Language}, 2nd ed. for \function{fopen()} and \function{fclose()}, and \S7.7 and \S{}B1.1.4 for \function{fgets()}.}
For each word, convert it to lowercase, and then traverse the list to find the appropriate place for the word.
(Note that there will not be a list to traverse when your code reads the first word!)
If the word is not in the list then create a node for that word and insert it into the list at the correct location.
If there is already a node containing that word, then increment that node's variable that tracks the number of occurrences.
Be sure that \textit{only} the word is placed in a node;
specifically, do not include a newline character nor any other characters that are not part of the word.

Build the program and correct all warnings and errors.\ When the program compiles without generating any warnings or errors, run it.
If your program requires more than a few seconds to build the list, there is a bug in your code.
If your program does not produce the expected output, the \function{print_list()} utility function will help you see the list that your code created.

\subsection{Respond to a Challenge, part 1}

You now have implemented enough of the other sub-problems that you can write the code to respond to a challenge if the number of occurrences is odd.

\lstinputlisting[linerange=93-111, firstnumber=93]{../starter-code/challenge-response.c}

After the word list is complete (after you have inserted all words in the file), the user will be prompted to enter the challenge word.
Add code to \function{respond()} that traverses the word list to find that word.
If the word is not present in the list, return ``(word) is not present!'', where ``(word)'' is the challenge word.

In KeyboardLab Problem~3, you wrote code to determine whether an integer value is even.
Add code to \function{respond()} such that if the challenge word is present in the list and the number of occurrences is even, the function returns ``(word) has (number) of occurrences'', where ``(word)'' is the challenge word and ``(number)'' is the number of occurrences.
If the number of occurrences is odd then use the number of occurrences recorded in that word's node to find the response word as described in the challenge-and-response rules, and return that word.
\textbf{(Do not copy the \function{is_even()} function into \textit{challenge-response.c};
we will link to the function in \textit{problem3.c}.)}

If you did not complete KeyboardLab, then place this code in your \textit{problem3.c} file:

\begin{lstlisting}
int is_even(int value) {
    return !(value % 2);
}
\end{lstlisting}

If your program does not provide the response word nearly instantaneously, there is a bug in your code.

\subsection*{Next Steps}

You have now completed a significant portion of the assignment: you can build the word list if the words in the file are already sorted, and you can provide the response to a challenge word if the number of occurrences is odd.
The next steps will require modifying some of your code, so this would be a good time to make a backup copy of \textit{challenge-response.c} or to commit it to a private Git repository.

In Section~\ref{subsec:doublylinkedlist} you will implement a \textit{doubly-linked list} which will allow you to write code to respond to a challenge word if the number of occurrences is even.
In Section~\ref{subsec:insertionsort} you will implement the \textit{Insertion Sort} algorithm which will allow you to build a list even when the words in the file are not already sorted.

You may tackle either of the remaining tasks before tackling the other.

\subsection{Designing the Data Structure and Its Algorithms, part 2, and \\ Respond to a Challenge, part 2: \\ Doubly-Linked List} \label{subsec:doublylinkedlist}

A \textit{doubly-linked list} is a linked list with the property that each node maintains a link not only to the \lstinline{next} node but also a link to the \lstinline{previous} node.
In C, these links are pointers.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{doubly-linked-list}
    \caption{Nodes in a doubly-linked list consist of the payload data and references that point to the previous and next nodes.}
\end{figure}

Inserting new node, $C$ between adjacent nodes $A$ and $B$ (where $B = A.next$ and $A = B.previous$) requires connecting $C.previous$ to $A$ and $C.next$ to $B$, and re-assigning $A.next$ to $C$ and $B.previous$ to $C$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dll-insertion}
    \caption{Inserting a new node into a doubly-linked list requires assignments to the affected \textit{previous} and \textit{next} pointers.}
\end{figure}

Modify your \function{insert_after()} function to update not only the \lstinline{next} pointers but also the \lstinline{previous} pointers so that \lstinline{new_node} is placed between \lstinline{existing_node} and the node that originally was located immediately after \lstinline{existing_node}.

After the program compiles without warnings or errors, you may want to use \function{print_list} to confirm that the \lstinline{previous} pointers are updated correctly.

Now implement \function{insert_before()}:

\lstinputlisting[linerange=48-53, firstnumber=48]{../starter-code/challenge-response.c}

If your program requires more than a few seconds to build the list, there is a bug in your code.

Update your \function{respond()} function so that when the number of occurrences is even, the returned string is not ``(word) has (number) of occurrences'' but is instead the appropriate response word as described in the challenge-and-response rules.

You can now provide the response to a challenge word regardless of whether the number of occurrences is even or odd.
This would be a good time to make a backup copy of \textit{challenge-response.c} or to commit it to a private Git repository.

\subsection{Inserting Words, part 2: Insertion Sort}\label{subsec:insertionsort}

While you probably learned about sorting in \cstwo, you may not have learned about \textit{Insertion Sort}.
If you did learn about Insertion Sort, you probably learned that it's a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm that is less efficient than $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
Insertion Sort has a particular advantage in that it can be applied \textit{as the list is built}, making for a much simpler and less error-prone implementation than a different sort that requires the list to already be built.

The Insertion Sort algorithm reads an input and then traverses a sorted list to find the proper location in the sorted list for the input.
The input is then inserted into the list at that location.

Your current implementation of \function{insert_word()} is based off of the assumption that the word is either at the tail of the list or is not present in the list.
Update \function{insert_word()} so that it looks for the word in the sorted list.
If the word is found, then update the number of occurrences as before.
If the word is not present in its proper location in the sorted list, then insert a new node for that word at its proper location in the sorted list.
If your program requires more than a few seconds to build the list, there is a bug in your code.

You can now provide build the word list regardless of whether the words in the file are already sorted.
This would be a good time to make a backup copy of \textit{challenge-response.c} or to commit it to a private Git repository.
