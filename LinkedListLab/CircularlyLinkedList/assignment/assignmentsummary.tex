This assignment is principally about getting comfortable when explicitly working with memory.
Being able to think about a value and a reference to that value distinctly will improve your programming skills in any language.

Before you do so, in Section~\ref{sec:archiesCode} you will examine Archie's code.
Parts of Archie's programs use code that the C standard explicitly states will result in undefined behavior.
By understanding the mistakes that Archie made, we hope that you can avoid them in your own code.

In Section~\ref{sec:challengeResponse}, you will build and use a linked list.
This will require you to allocate space for the list's nodes and manipulate pointers that connect the nodes to each other.
