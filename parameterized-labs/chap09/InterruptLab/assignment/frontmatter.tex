In this assignment, you will write code for \runtimeenvironment\ that will use interrupts from external devices and from a timer to compose short text messages using the Cow~Pi's keypad.

The instructions are written assuming you will develop the code using PlatformIO    % TODO - parameterize this?
and run the code on \runtimeenvironment.

\section*{Learning Objectives}

After successful completion of this assignment, students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use tables from a datasheet to determine the bit vectors needed to configure I/O devices
    \item Configure a hardware timer to generate interrupts
    \item Register an interrupt service routine for an interrupt vector
    \item Register an interrupt service routine using a higher abstraction
    \item Use interrupt-driven I/O to realize simple requirements
\end{itemize}

\section*{During Lab Time}

During your lab period, the TAs will guide the class through the first modifications to the starter code that you must make.
During the remaining time, the TAs will be available to answer questions.

During your lab period (and only during your lab period), you may discuss problem decomposition and solution design with your lab partner.
\textit{Be sure to add your name and your partner's name to the top of your source code files.}
To receive full credit for the work you and your partner do during lab time, you must be an active participate in the partnership.
In accordance with the School of Computing's Academic Integrity Policy, we reserve the right to adjust your calculated grade if you merely ``tag along'' and let your partner do all the thinking.

If you worked with a partner, then before leaving lab, upload \requiredfiles\ to Canvas to create a record of what you and your partner worked on during lab time.
After you have finished the full assignment, you will upload your completed work as well.
If you did not work with a partner, you do not need to upload your files until you have completed the assignment.
