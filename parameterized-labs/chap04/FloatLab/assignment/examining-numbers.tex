\subsection{Extracting the Integer, Fraction, and Exponent} \label{subsec:printing}

There are three functions that extract the components of a value's magnitude.
These three functions all assume that the value is a finite number:
the value might be a normal number;
it might be a subnormal number;
it might be zero.

\begin{description}
    \checkoffitem{Implement \function{get_754_integer()} to produce the implicit integer portion of the significand.}
    \checkoffitem{Implement \function{get_754_fraction()} to return the fraction bits exactly as they appear in the \lstinline{number}.}
    \checkoffitem{Implement \function{get_754_exponent()} to produce the two's complement representation of the exponent that you get after removing the bias from the \lstinline{number}'s \texttt{E} field.}
\end{description}

You will use \function{ieee754_to_string()} to test your code.

\subsection{\texttt{unnormal\_t} and Its Functions} \label{subsec:unnormal}

The \lstinline{unnormal_t} data type is a structure with fields for the sign bit, the integer portion, the fractional portion, and the exponent.
It also has flags for Not-a-Number and for Infinity.
Unlike the IEEE~754 format, an \lstinline{unnormal_t} value can have more than one bit in its integer portion.

%\begin{center}
\hspace{-2cm}\colorbox{red!25}{The \lstinline{unnormal_t} type does not correspond to any floating point type described in the IEEE~754 standard!}
%\end{center}

You should \textit{not} access the \lstinline{unnormal_t} fields directly.
Instead, use the \function{unnormal()} macro to create an \lstinline{unnormal_t} value, the accessor functions that we provide to retrieve the fields, and the modifier functions that we provide to make adjustments in a value-preserving manner.

\textit{\textbf{NOTE:}} while you typically will see non-primitive variables passed by reference to C functions, the \lstinline{unnormal_t} functions use pass-by-value.
This is considerably less efficient in both time and memory (and there are other downsides beyond the scope of what you've learned so far);
however, passing the \lstinline{unnormal_t} variables by value ensures that there will be no aliased variables and also that memory management will be handled by the program stack.
\textcolor{red}{This means that the variables passed as arguments to functions will be unchanged, and if an \lstinline{unnormal_t} variable is returned then it will be a modified copy of the original.
A consequence of this is that \textit{you must make sure that you always use the value returned by a function if you expect to use the effect of the function.}}

You can, and should, look at the functions' signatures in \textit{unnormal.h}.
\textcolor{red}{The shift functions and the alignment functions are \textit{value-preserving}: changes to the significand create corresponding changes to the exponent, and vice-versa.}
We summarize the functions that you are likely to use here (there are more functions than we list here, and you may use \textit{any} function that is declared in \textit{unnormal.h}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Creating and printing an \lstinline{unnormal_t} value (all necessary calls to these functions are in the starter code)
    \begin{description}
        \item[unnormal()] returns an \lstinline{unnormal_t} value (\textit{not} a pointer) based on the arguments provided.
            The argument list is a series of dot-prefixed named fields (such as \lstinline{.sign=0, .infinity=1}) whose meanings are the obvious ones from the class discussion about floating point numbers.
            \colorbox{green}{\textit{\textbf{Note: }} the \lstinline{.exponent} argument, if} \\ \colorbox{green}{included, is expected to be a two's complement value.}
            \colorbox{yellow}{\textit{\textbf{Note: }} the \lstinline{.fraction}} \\ \colorbox{yellow}{argument, if included, is expected to be the numerator of $\frac{.fraction\ argument}{2^{64}}$ (\textit{i.e.},} \\ \colorbox{yellow}{the $2^{-1}$ bit is $bit_{63}$)\@.}
        \item[unnormal\_to\_string()] returns a string representation of the value.
            Because of the number of bits available in the \lstinline{unnormal_t} fields, the significand is represented in base-16, though the exponent is the exponent of 2.
    \end{description}
    \item Accessors
    \begin{description}
        \item[get\_unnormal\_sign()] returns 0 if the value is positive, 1 if the value is negative
        \item[get\_unnormal\_integer()] returns a \lstinline{uint64_t} storing the unsigned integer representation of the value's integer portion
        \item[get\_unnormal\_fraction()] returns a \lstinline{uint64_t} storing the numerator of $\frac{get\_fraction()}{2^{64}}$ (\textit{i.e.}, the $2^{-1}$ bit is $bit_{63}$)
        \item[get\_unnormal\_exponent()] returns a \lstinline{int16_t} storing the two's complement representation of the exponent
        \item[is\_infinite()] returns 0 if the value is finite (or NaN), 1 if the value is $\pm\infty$
        \item[is\_not\_a\_number()] returns 0 if the value is a valid number, 1 if the value is not a number
    \end{description}
    \item Bit shifts (some of these functions are equivalent to each other, to support whichever mental model works for you)
    \begin{description}
        \item[shift\_left\_once()] aka \function{decrement_exponent()}, aka \function{move_binary_point_to_the_right()} -- shifts the significand's bits to the left by one position, having the effect of moving the binary point to the right and decreasing the exponent by one
        \item[shift\_right\_once()] aka \function{increment_exponent()}, aka \function{move_binary_point_to_the_left()} -- shifts the significand's bits to the right by one position, having the effect of moving the binary point to the left and increasing the exponent by one
%        \item[shift\_left()] shifts the significand's bits to the left by a specified amount
%        \item[shift\_right()] shifts the significand's bits to the right by a specified amount
    \end{description}
    \item Alignment functions (shifts bits by specifying the desired result instead of the amount)
    \begin{description}
        \item[place\_all\_bits\_in\_integer()] aka \function{prepare_for_arithmetic()} shifts the significand such that the least-significant \lstinline{1} bit is in the $2^0$ position, with a corresponding change in the exponent (the fraction, of course, will be 0)
        \item[set\_integer()] if possible, shifts the significand such that the resulting integer portion is the specified value, with a corresponding changes in the fraction and exponent
        \item[set\_exponent()] shifts the significand, with a corresponding change in the exponent, such that the resulting exponent is the specified value
    \end{description}
    \item Static Warnings (warnings based on the current bit positions)
    \begin{description}
%        \item[multiplication\_is\_not\_recommended()] indicates that there are \lstinline{1} bits to the right of the binary point:
%                if there are \lstinline{1} bits in the fraction, then there will be extra bookkeeping that you will be responsible for;
%                we recommend that you attempt multiplication only when all \lstinline{1} bits are in the integer portion
%        \item[multiplication\_is\_unreliable()] indicates that there are \lstinline{1} bits far enough to the left of the binary point that multiplication could yield a product whose integer portion exceeds the available bits
        \item[addition\_is\_unreliable()] indicates that there are \lstinline{1} bits far enough to the left of the binary point that addition could yield a sum whose integer portion exceeds the available bits
    \end{description}
    \item Dynamic Warnings (warnings that result from the last function call)
    \begin{description}
%        \item[shift\_overflowed()] indicates that one or more \lstinline{1} bit shifted to the left beyond the available bits
%        \item[shift\_underflowed()] indicates that one or more \lstinline{1} bit shifted to the right beyond the available bits
%        \item[operation\_was\_not\_performed()] indicates that the previous function did not have the desired result, such as attempting to shift by a negative amount or attempt to set an integer value whose bits are not present in the significand
        \item[created\_number\_is\_improbable()] indicates that a call to \function{unnormal()} was made with all of the fraction's \lstinline{1} far enough from the binary point that it is unlikely to have been the intended value (because it is \textit{possible} that the requested fraction is also the intended fraction, an Unnormal value with the requested fraction was created)
    \end{description}
    \item Prediction Functions (warnings that indicate what will happen in the next operation)
    \begin{description}
%        \item[fraction\_will\_carry\_into\_integer\_on\_addition()] indicates that if the next operation is addition with the specified values, then adding the fractions will carry into the integer portion, requiring you to add 1 to the sum's integer
%        \item[fraction\_will\_borrow\_from\_integer\_on\_subtraction()] indicates that if the next operation is subtraction with the specified values, then subtracting the fractions will require ``borrowing'' from the integer portion, requiring you to subtract 1 to the difference's integer
%        \item[left\_shift\_will\_make\_multiplication\_unreliable()] indicates that if the next function is \function{left_shift_once()} (or one of its aliases) then after that function call, \function{multiplication_is_unreliable()} will return \lstinline{true}
        \item[left\_shift\_will\_make\_addition\_unreliable()] indicates that if the next function is \function{left_shift_once()} (or one of its aliases) then after that function call, \\ \function{addition_is_unreliable()} will return \lstinline{true}
%        \item[left\_shift\_will\_overflow()] indicates that if the next function is \function{left_shift_once()} (or one of its aliases) then after that function call, \function{shift_overflowed()} will return \lstinline{true}
%        \item[right\_shift\_will\_underflow()] indicates that if the next function is \function{right_shift_once()} (or one of its aliases) then after that function call, \function{shift_underflowed()} will return \lstinline{true}
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decoding Numbers from the IEEE 754 Format into \texttt{unnormal\_t}} \label{subsec:decoding}

The \function{decode()} function converts an IEEE~754-compliant \lstinline{ieee754_t} value into a format that facilitates arithmetic.
As described in Section~\ref{subsec:unnormal}, the \lstinline{unnormal_t} structure that is returned by \function{decode()} has fields for the sign bit, the integer portion, the fractional portion, and the exponent.
It also has flags for Not-a-Number and for Infinity.
Unlike the IEEE~754 format, an \lstinline{unnormal_t} value can have more than one bit in its integer portion.

You have already done most of the work to populate an \lstinline{unnormal_t} structure.
In \function{decode()} you will need to left-shift the \lstinline{fraction} returned by \function{get_754_fraction()} by several places such that the $2^{-1}$ bit is in $bit_{63}$ (the most-significant bit) of an \lstinline{uint64_t} bit vector, the $2^{-2}$ bit is in $bit_{62}$, and so on.
This is because the \function{unnormal()} function call expects the \lstinline{.fraction} named field to be the numerator of
\[\frac{.fraction\ argument}{2^{64}}\]


\subsubsection{A Visualization}

Envision the 64 bits in the \lstinline{.integer} field and the 64 bits in the \lstinline{.fraction} field:
\[ i_{63} i_{62} i_{61} i_{60} \cdots i_3 i_2 i_1 i_0\ \mathbf{.} \ f_{63} f_{62} f_{61} f_{60} \cdots f_3 f_2 f_1 f_0 \]

If we have the number $1\frac{3}{4}$, and if we were to place the \lstinline{ieee754_t}'s fraction bits directly into the \lstinline{unnormal_t}'s \lstinline{.fraction} field, then we would have:
\[ 0000 \cdots 0001\ \mathbf{.} \ 0000 \cdots 0110\ 0000 \cdots 0000 \]
giving us the value $1\frac{3 \times 2^{21}}{2^{64}} = 1\frac{3}{2^{43}}$, which not what we want.
On the other hand, if we were to shift the fraction bits by $(64 - NUMBER\_OF\_FRACTION\_BITS)$ places, then we would have:
\[ 0000 \cdots 0001\ \mathbf{.} \ 1100 \cdots 0000 \]
giving us the value $1\frac{3 \times 2^{62}}{2^{64}} = 1\frac{3}{2^2} = 1\frac{3}{4}$.

This is why the fraction bits need to be shifted so that the bit corresponding to the $2^{-1}$ place is in $bit_{63}$.

\subsubsection{Examples}

Suppose that the number is $68588.0_{10} = 1.0000,1011,1110,11_{2} \times 2^{16}$.
In the IEEE~754 normal form, this is 0x4785'F600 = 0b0\underline{100'0111'1}000'0101'1111'0110'0000'0000 (we have underlined the $E$ field to help you follow the discussion).

In the \lstinline{unnormal_t} data structure, the \lstinline{.integer} is 1, the \lstinline{.exponent} is 16, and the \lstinline{.fraction} is 0x0BEC'0000'0000'0000.
Mathematically, that is the \lstinline{.fraction} field because the fraction field needs to be the numerator of
\[\frac{BEC,0000,0000,0000_{16}}{1,0000,0000,0000,0000_{16}}\]
That is why you need to left-shift the \lstinline{fraction} by several places (so that the $2^{-1}$ bit is in the most-significant bit) before passing it to the \function{unnormal()} function.

To see this from a practical perspective, let us consider some of the functions defined for \lstinline{unnormal_t}.
In these examples, assume that all numbers are stored in \lstinline{unnormal_t} data structures.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{shift\_left\_once($1.0000,1011,1110,11_{2} \times 2^{16}$)}} will return a \textit{copy} of the original \lstinline{unnormal_t} data structure, except that the significand's bits have been left-shifted by one, and the fraction has been decreased by one;
        specifically, it will return \\ $10.0001,0111,1101,1_{2} \times 2^{15}$.
        (The original data structure will be unchanged.)
    \item \textbf{\texttt{shift\_right($10.0001,0111,1101,1_{2} \times 2^{15}$, 4)}} will return \\
        $0.0010,0001,0111,1101,1_{2} \times 2^{19}$: the significand's bits have been right-shifted by four, and the fraction has increased by four.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{place\_all\_bits\_in\_integer($0.0010,0001,0111,1101,1_{2} \times 2^{19}$)}} will return \\
        $100,0010,1111,1011.0_{2} \times 2^{2}$.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{set\_exponent($100,0010,1111,1011.0_{2} \times 2^{2}$, 0)}} will return  \\
        $1,0000,1011,1110,1100.0_{2} \times 2^{0}$.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{set\_integer($1,0000,1011,1110,1100.0_{2} \times 2^{0}$, 1)}} will return  \\
        $1.0000,1011,1110,11_{2} \times 2^{16}$.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Decoding Numbers}

The \lstinline{integer} and \lstinline{exponent} variables can obtain their correct values directly from the \function{get_754_integer()} and \function{get_754_exponent()} functions.
The \lstinline{fraction} variable, however, needs to shift the value obtained from \function{get_754_fraction()}.

\begin{description}
    \checkoffitem{Assign the appropriate value to \lstinline{fraction}.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Because the value obtained from \function{get_754_fraction()} has the fraction bits in the \lstinline{NUMBER_OF_FRACTION_BITS} least-significant bits,
            and because the most significant bit is $bit_{63}$, placing the $2^{-1}$ bit in the most significant bit can be accomplished by shifting the fraction bits by $(64 - NUMBER\_OF\_FRACTION\_BITS)$ places.
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}


\paragraph*{Check Your Work}

\begin{description}
    \checkoffitem{Compile and run \texttt{\textbf{\textit{./floatlab}}}, decoding a few values.}
\end{description}
We have provided a function that will print a \lstinline{unnormal_t} value.
When you run \texttt{\textbf{\textit{./floatlab}}}, you can specify that you want to decode a value, such as \texttt{\textbf{\textit{decode 12.375}}}.
The program will then print the value, based on the \lstinline{unnormal_t} fields.
Because there are 64 bits available for the integer portion and another 64 bits for the fractional portion, the \lstinline{unnormal_t} value will be printed in base-16:

\begin{verbatim}
        Enter a value, a two-operand arithmetic expression,
            "decode <value>", "recode <value>",
            or "quit": decode 12.375
        +0000000000000001.8c00000000000000_{16} x 2^{3}
\end{verbatim}

Because $12.375_{10} = 1.1000,11_{2} \times 2^3$, we can see that $1.8\mathrm{C}_{16} \times 2^3$ is correct.

%When denormalizing, you can optionally specify an amount to change the exponent.
%For example:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%    Enter ... "decode <value> <change exponent amount>", ...
%        or "quit": decode 12.375 -4
%    +0000000000000018.c000000000000000_{16} x 2^{-1}
%
%    Enter ... "decode <value> <change exponent amount>", ...
%        or "quit": decode 12.375 3
%    +0000000000000000.3180000000000000_{16} x 2^{6}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%If your \function{decode()} function works correctly without the exponent adjustment, then it will work with the exponent adjustment.
%This feature is not useful to you \textit{now}, but you may find it useful if you need to debug your \function{encode()} function.
