Observe that the matrix keypad has sixteen buttons has eight pins in its female connector.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:keypad-annotated}, when the keypad is face-up and oriented for reading, the four pins on the left are the \textit{row} pins, and the four pins on the right are the \textit{column} pins.
From left-to-right, we will name these pins \texttt{row1}, \texttt{row4}, \texttt{row7}, \texttt{row*}, \texttt{column1}, \texttt{column2}, \texttt{column3}, \texttt{columnA}.
Figure~\ref{fig:keypad-matrix} shows the membrane contacts and which \developmentboard\ pin will be connected to each keypad pin.

    \item \textbf{NOTE}: if you used 20cm wires to connect your slide-switches and/or pushbuttons to the \developmentboard, then you can use the matrix keypad's ribbon cable to pull these wires away from the circuit, reducing clutter near the controls (Figure~\ref{fig:keypad-pullingwires}).

\checkpoint{inserted and wired the matrix keypad}

\textbf{NOTE:} Do not press more than one key on the matrix keypad at a time.
There are certain combinations of keys that could result in a short-circuit from power to ground, possibly damaging your \developmentboard.
Your \developmentboard\ has some safety measures to prevent damage in that situation, but it would be better for you not to test those safety measures.

Connect your \developmentboard\ to the computer.
In the IDE's Serial Monitor, notice that there is normally no character after \texttt{Keypad:}, that Column~pins is normally 1111, and that Keypad~NAND is normally 0.
Press the 5 key on the matrix keypad.
Notice that the first line of the message from the \developmentboard\ is now
\begin{verbatim}
    Keypad:      5        Column pins:  1011    Keypad NAND: 1
\end{verbatim}
In general, when you press a key on the keypad, the corresponding character will be displayed after \texttt{Keypad:}, and Keypad~NAND will become 1.
When you press 1, 4, 7, or *, Column~pins becomes 0111;
similarly, pressing a key in the 2$^{nd}$ column causes Column~pins to become 1011;
in the 3$^{rd}$ column, 1101;
and in the A$^{th}$ column, 1110.
Be sure to test all 16 keys.
