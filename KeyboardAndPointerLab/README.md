# KeyboardLab and PointerLab Combination

During semesters in which we have labs only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, each
lab section meets the same number of times. During semesters in which we also
have labs on Mondays, the Monday lab section meets only fourteen times (due to
Labor Day), while the Tuesday and Wednesday lab sections still meet fifteen 
times. We could have one less lab assignment -- and if students were more
familiar with C, I might go for this option. Or we could assign a lab during
the shortened week and expect the Monday lab students to attend more office
hours -- let's just say I ruled this option out before I ruled out having one
less lab assignment. Or we could have a full-blown two-week lab -- I considered
this but ruled it out because the Tuesday/Wednesday lab students would still
have an unfair advantage over the Monday students since they'd have the
mid-assignment lab section for extra help that the Monday students wouldn't
have.

What I did instead is created what later in the semester would be a "full"
(perhaps heavy) one-week lab and expect students to complete it in two.
That is this lab.

As you should infer from the name, it starts with [KeyboardLab](../KeyboardLab)
and concludes with a "lite" version of [PointerLab](../PointerLab).
