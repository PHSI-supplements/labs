# PokerLab

This lab is designed to help students get started (or re-familiarize
themselves) with C programming. We used to start with a lab that has a quine,
a problem with ill-defined stack behavior, and a linked list, but within a
semester of me teaching the course, I added "Homework 0" for a shallower
learning curve. "Homework 0" evolved into PokerLab.

Students will see code that has some of C's quirks: integers as booleans,
strings as arrays, arrays as pointers, explicitly allocating memory, `printf`
format strings -- all sorts of C goodness. They'll then apply what they
learned (and learn from mistakes) by finishing the program's implementation.

There is no autograder for this lab -- I wrote this assignment to have an
effort-based grade, and I'm keeping it as a low-pressure assignment by keeping
it as having an effort-based grade. If you adopt this assignment, you're free
to change that to a correctness-based grade, and if you ask I'll probably write
an autograder for you (at least for the part that *can* be autograded).
