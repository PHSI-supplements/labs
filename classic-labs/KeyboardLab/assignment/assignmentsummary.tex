In this assignment, you will write five functions, each solving a simple problem that, if not for your ``broken keyboard,'' you would be able to solve easily.
The ``damage'' to your keyboard as the scenario progresses will require you to treat data differently than you have in the past.

In Section~\ref{sec:asciiTable}, you will need to use some characters' ASCII values -- that is, integers -- in place of the characters when constructing a string.
In Section~\ref{sec:charactersAsNumbers}, you will need to use characters as though they were integers and perform arithmetic upon them.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:bitOps}, you will manipulate integers using bit operations.

\subsection{Constraints}

Each section restricts the use of certain characters on your keyboard.
These restrictions do not prohibit the use of those characters in comments, but you may not use those characters in  your code.
We will provide you with a tool to check whether you inadvertently used one of those characters.
