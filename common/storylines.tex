\newcommand{\MeetArchie}{
    You're relaxing at your favorite hangout when another customer catches your attention.
    He's rather large (dare I say, \textit{mammoth}), a bit hairy, and looking frustrated in front of his laptop.
    ``I'm Archie,'' he says, ``and I'm trying to teach myself this card game called \textit{Poker}.
    I found this source code that I thought I could use to understand Poker better, but the code is incomplete, and I don't entirely understand what's there.
    Could you explain the code to me, please?'
}

\newcommand{\GetHired}{
    Archie's face lights up in a very big smile.
    ``Thanks!''
    After pausing in thought for a moment, he says, ``Say, I've got a new startup company that could really use your help.
    Are you interested?
    It'll be exciting!''
}
