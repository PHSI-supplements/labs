    You're relaxing at your favorite hangout when another customer catches your attention.
    He's rather large (dare I say, \textit{mammoth}), a bit hairy, and looking frustrated in front of his laptop.
    ``I'm Archie,'' he says, ``and I'm trying to teach myself this card game called \textit{Poker}.
    I found this source code that I thought I could use to understand Poker better, but the code is incomplete, and I don't entirely understand what's there.
    Could you explain the code to me, please?'
}

\newcommand{\GetHired}{
    Archie's face lights up in a very big smile.
    ``Thanks!''
    After pausing in thought for a moment, he says, ``Say, I've got a new startup company that could really use your help.
    Are you interested?
    It'll be exciting!''
}

    You've recently been hired to help get the Pleistocene Petting Zoo get started.
    Your new employer, Archie, is surprisingly honest: he admits to you that some expenses were spared.
    Archie cheerfully points out that any challenge is also an opportunity to succeed.
    You suspect your job will offer plenty of ``opportunities to succeed.''
}

\newcommand{\HasKeyboard}{
    Great news!
    Archie brings you your new keyboard.
    He also brings you a problem of his own.
    Because you were held up with the broken keyboard, Archie decided to try some programming on his own, and his code is behaving strangely.
}

\newcommand{\ArchieWroteSmellyCode}{
    Working at the Pleistocene Petting Zoo certainly is proving to be interesting.
    You're glad that you don't have to worry about the problem of the giant sloths very slowly chasing their handlers, but now it seems that Archie has decided to try to write a program or two.
    At a glance, his code is smellier than the wooly rhinoceros' enclosure.
    But you take a closer look anyway to try to understand why his code acts strangely.
}

\newcommand{\InsurancePreview}{
    You hear somebody enter the room.
    ``\textit{Frankenstein}, `boat','' is the challenge, and she answers, ``borne.''
    Archie introduces you to the new arrival, ``Lil, this is our new developer, the one who wrote the app we just used.''
    He turns to you: ``This is Lilith Redd from business operations.''
    He turns back to her and continues, ``Lil, what's the good word?''

    ``The word isn't good, I'm afraid.
    I just heard back from the insurance company.''
}
