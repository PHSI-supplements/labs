    If the TA cannot create an executable from your code, then your code will be assumed to have no functionality.\footnote{
        At the TA's discretion, if they can make your code compile with \textit{one} edit (such as introducing a missing semicolon) then they may do so and then assess a 10\% penalty on the resulting score.
        The TA is under no obligation to do so, and you should not rely on the TA's willingness to edit your code for grading.
        If there are multiple options for a single edit that would make your code compile, there is no guarantee that the TA will select the option that would maximize your score.

    This assignment is due before the start of your lab section.
    The due date in \filesubmission\ is five minutes after that, which is ample time for you to arrive to lab and then discover that you'd forgotten to turn in your work without \filesubmission\ reporting your work as having been turned in late.
    We will accept late turn-ins up to one hour late, assessing a 10\% penalty on these late submissions.
    Any work turned in more than one hour late will not be graded.
