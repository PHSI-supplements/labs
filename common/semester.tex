    The EE Shop has prepared ``class kits'' for CSCE 231; your class kit costs \$20. The EE Shop is located at 122 Scott
    Engineering Center and is open M-F 7am-4pm. You do not need an appointment. You may pay at the window with cash,
    with a personal check, or with your NCard. If you wish to pay by credit card, you must make the purchase from
    \url{https://marketplace.unl.edu/ees/engineering-class-kits/csce231-kit.html} the day before you visit the EE
    Shop.\footnote{The price listed on the website is \$18.65; after sales tax is added, your total will be \$20.}
