# Hardware Prelabs

[//]: # (Hardware Prelabs © 2021-25 Christopher A. Bohn)

In this series of prelabs,
- You will confirm that your hardware kit is stocked with functioning components,
- You will prepare your development environment for the labs that use the hardware kit,
- You will learn how to safely attach and detach the peripheral devices to/from the Cow Pi, and
- You will learn how to display debugging information on the Cow Pi's display.

Unless you encounter difficulties, prelabs 1-7 should only take a few minutes each, and prelab 8 may require several minutes.
The purpose of these prelabs is to deal with any difficulties *before* the labs that use the hardware kit so that your work on those labs is not delayed by kit-related difficulties. 

The prelabs collectively are worth 1 point.

## Obtaining the Hardware Kit

You can check out a hardware kit by visiting Avery 27 during your scheduled lab time in the second week of BombLab.
The School of Computing's tech support team will have someone at the front desk ready to help you.

If you cannot visit Avery 27 at that time, you can schedule an appointment by sending an email to [support@cse.unl.edu](mailto:support@cse.unl.edu?subject=CSCE%20231%20Cow%20Pi%20Checkout).

## Front Matter

### Submission Deadlines

This prelabs are due across several dates so that you don't put off all eight prelabs until the last minute.
The due dates are set to allow ample time to deal with problems before the first lab that uses the hardware kit.

You will indicate your completion of the prelabs through Canvas assignments.
There are no "wrong" answers for those Canvas assignments,
and we will not check whether you actually completed the prelab tasks.
However, if you pencil-whip the Canvas assignments without completing the prelab tasks, 
then you will not discover any problems until you start using the hardware for labs,
and you will have to still have to set up your development environment before starting the first lab that uses the hardware kit.

### Collaboration Rules

You may collaborate freely with other students on the prelabs.

### Generative AI Rules

You may freely use generative AI tools for the prelabs.

### Learning Objectives

There are no learning objectives for the prelabs.
Their sole purpose is to uncover problems with the hardware kit and to set up your development environment for the labs that use the hardware kit.
