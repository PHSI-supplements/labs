## Constants and Queries

### Constants

There are seven named constants in *fpu.c*.

- [ ] Assign the appropriate bit vectors to `SIGN_BIT_MASK`, `EXPONENT_BITS_MASK`, and `FRACTION_BITS_MASK` so that you can use them to mask-off the sign bit, the exponent bits, and the fraction bits, respectively, in a `ieee754_t` floating point value.
- [ ] Assign the single-precision exponent bias to `EXPONENT_BIAS` and assign to `NUMBER_OF_FRACTION_BITS` the number of bits used for the fraction bit field in a single-precision floating point number.
- [ ] Assign to `NAN` and `INFINITY` suitable bit vectors for single-precision Infinity and Not-a-Number.

These constants will not be graded directly;
they exist solely to make your code more readable.
You may define additional named constants as needed.


### Query Functions

There are three functions to identify whether an `ieee754_t` floating point value is neither normal nor subnormal.
The remaining query function determines whether an `ieee754_t` floating point value is negative.

- [ ] Implement `is_nan()` to detect whether a value is Not-a-Number without regard to the value's sign.
  - Note that `is_nan()` must return `true` for *all* valid NaN bit vectors and not just those that match your `NAN` constant. 
- [ ] Implement `is_infinity()` to detect whether a value is infinity without regard to the value's sign.
- [ ] Implement `is_zero()` to detect whether a value is zero without regard to the value's sign.
- [ ] Implement `is_negative()` to detect whether a value is negative.

You will use `ieee754_to_string()` to test your code.


#### Check Your Work

- [ ] Compile and run *floatlab*, testing the query functions with a few values.

For example:

`Enter a value, ... or "quit":`

| Input | Characterization |
|:-----:|-----------------:|
|   0   |             +0.0 |
|  -0   |             -0.0 |
|  inf  |        +Infinity |
| -inf  |        -Infinity |
|  nan  |    +Not a Number |
| -nan  |    -Not a Number |

> 🪢 **Reminder**
> 
> `is_nan()` must return `true` for *all* valid NaN bit vectors.
> You may want to test `is_nan()` with hexadecimal constants other than what is produced by with the input "nan".
