## Remotely Operating an Arm

- [ ] [Attach the Servo and the Rotary Encoder Module to the Cow&nbsp;Pi](BB-peripherals.md).
- [ ] Place the Cow&nbsp;Pi's **right** switch in the *right* position.
- [ ] Compile the program and upload it to the Cow&nbsp;Pi.

When you turn the rotary encoder's shaft clockwise from one detent to the next, the servo arm will step one position clockwise.
Similarly, when you turn the rotary encoder's shaft counterclockwise from one detent to the next, the servo arm will step one position counterclockwise.

You now have a Cow&nbsp;Pi-based remote controller for a servo, assuming that you consider 30cm to be "remote".
