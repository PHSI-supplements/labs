## Turn-In and Grading

Be sure that you have pushed your code to git.unl.edu, and that you have submitted the [Connection to Nuros](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/200913/assignments/2094033) Canvas assignment and the [PokerLab Code Study](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/200913/quizzes/468941) Canvas quiz.

### Normally No Credit for Uncompilable Code

If the TA cannot create an executable from your code, then your code will be assumed to have no functionality.
For most lab assignments, this would mean that you would earn very few, if any, points.
For this lab assignment, you will still receive some credit for attempting the assignment, even if it does not compile.
Be sure to compile and test your code on the nuros.unl.edu Linux server with the original driver code, the original header file(s), and the original CMake configuration files.

> ✍️ **One Edit Rule**
> 
> At the TA's discretion, if they can make your code compile with one edit (such as introducing a missing semicolon) then they may do so and then assess a 10% penalty on the resulting score.
> The TA is under no obligation to do so, and you should not rely on the TA’s willingness to edit your code for grading.
> If there are multiple options for a single edit that would make your code compile, there is no guarantee that the TA will select the option that would maximize your score.

### Late Submissions

This assignment is due before the start of your lab section.
If you have late days available, you may use one or more to extend your deadline.
You can exercise a late day (or days) by editing the [LATE-DAYS-USED-ON-THIS-ASSIGNMENT.txt](../submission_metadata.json) file and including the update with your code.

After you have exhausted your late days, we will accept late turn-ins up to one hour late, assessing a 10% penalty on these late submissions.
After you have exhausted your late days, any work turned in more than one hour late will not be graded.
