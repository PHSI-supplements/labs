We will distribute the assignment documents and starter code to a Git repository that we are providing to you. 
We will collect your completed assignments from that same repository.

If you have not already done so, create an account on [git.unl.edu](https://git.unl.edu).

Navigate a web browser to [git.unl.edu](https://git.unl.edu).
Sign-in under "University of Nebraska - Lincoln" (not "University of Nebraska").
If you accidentally sign in under the wrong institution, you can get back to the original menu by clearing browser cookies from the domain incommonfederation.org.
If you see a message that your account is blocked, click on the "Request Service" button on [this page](https://nusupport.nebraska.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=77) and let the TAs know immediately.

After you have submitted your git.unl.edu username, a TA will assign to you one of the Git repositories that already has the assignment and starter code for the code portion of this week's assignment.
They will place the URL in a comment in the "git.unl.edu username" Canvas assignment and mark the Canvas assignment as "Complete".

When you get to the "Clone Your Git Repository" step, check this assignment's comments for the URL to your Git repository.
