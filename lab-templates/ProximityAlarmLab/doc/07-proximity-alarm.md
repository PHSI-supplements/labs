## A Proximity Alarm

- [ ] [Attach the Piezobuzzer Module and the Distance Sensor Module to the Cow&nbsp;Pi](BB-peripherals.md).
- [ ] Place the Cow&nbsp;Pi's **right** switch in the *right* position.
- [ ] Compile the program and upload it to the Cow&nbsp;Pi.

You now have a Cow&nbsp;Pi-based proximity alarm that will alert when somebody -- or some*thing* gets to close.
It will repeatedly pulse the rangefinder, and will sound an alarm that becomes more urgent as the object gets closer.
