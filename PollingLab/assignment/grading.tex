\subsection*{No Credit for Uncompilable Code}
If the TA cannot create an executable from your code, then your code will be assumed to have no functionality.\footnote{
    At the TA's discretion, if they can make your code compile with \textit{one} edit (such as introducing a missing semicolon) then they may do so and then assess a 10\% penalty on the resulting score.
    The TA is under no obligation to do so, and you should not rely on the TA's willingness to edit your code for grading.
    If there are multiple options for a single edit that would make your code compile, there is no guarantee that the TA will select the option that would maximize your score.
}
Before turning in your code, be sure to compile and test your code on \runtimeenvironment\ with the original driver code, the original header file(s), and using the Arduino IDE\@.

\subsection*{Rubric}

This assignment is worth 40 points.
\begin{description}
    \item[Initial Changes to the Code] % 5
    \rubricitem{1}{The \lstinline{key} nested array is correctly populated}
    \rubricitem{2}{The correct addresses are assigned to \lstinline{ioports} and \lstinline{i2c}}
    \rubricitem{2}{The \function{key_movement_detected()} function is correctly implemented}

    \item[Memory-Mapped Input/Output] % 18
    \rubricitem{4}{The simple input/output functions are correctly implemented (1 point for \\ \function{xx_switch_is_in_right_position()} functions; 1 point for \function{xx_button_is_pressed()} functions; 2 points for \function{set_xx_led()} functions)}
    \rubricitem{8}{The \function{get_keypress()} function is correctly implemented (\textonehalf\ point for each key)}
    \rubricitem{6}{The \function{send_halfbyte()} function is correctly implemented (3 points for the I$^2$C protocol, 3 points for data sent to the LCD1602)}

    \item[Implementing a Simple System using Polling] % 17
    \rubricitem{2}{Left justified mode and right justified mode are implemented correctly}
    \rubricitem{2}{Decimal and hexadecimal number bases are implemented correctly}
    \rubricitem{2}{The LED illumination occurs as specified}
    \rubricitem{2}{The first digit of a number is displayed in the correct position, making a blank display no longer blank, in accordance with requirements~\ref{spec:decimalExplained}, \ref{spec:hexadecimalExplained}, and \ref{spec:initialKeyPress}}
    \rubricitem{2}{Subsequent digits update the number in accordance with requirements~\ref{spec:decimalExplained}, \ref{spec:hexadecimalExplained}, and \ref{spec:BuildingValue}}
    \rubricitem{2}{The left pushbutton negates the number's value (\textonehalf\ point for each of: negating positive decimal values, negating negative decimal values, negating positive hexadecimal values, negating negative hexadecimal values)}
    \rubricitem{2}{Detects and displays correct message when the number being built is too big (\textonequarter\ point for detecting too-big numbers for each of: positive decimal numbers, negative decimal numbers, positive hexadecimal numbers, negative hexadecimal numbers; \textonequarter\ point for no false detections among each of: decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers; \textonehalf\ point for printing the correct message)}
    \rubricitem{2}{The right pushbutton causes a copy of the number to be displayed on the bottom row for one second, after which the display clears}
    \rubricitem{1}{A button press or a key press is treated as a single press}

    \item[Bonuses]
    \bonusitem{2}{Displays the numbers without making use of any functions in the \function{printf()} family (\function{printf()} and related functions appear only in \function{test_io()})}
    \bonusitem{2}{Get assignment checked-off by TA or professor during office hours before it is due (you cannot get both check-off bonuses)}
    \bonusitem{1}{Get assignment checked-off by TA at \textit{start} of your scheduled lab immediately after it is due (your code must be uploaded to \filesubmission\ \textit{before} it is due; you cannot get both bonuses)}

    \item[Penalties]
    \penaltyitem{2}{The \function{key_was_pressed()} function's implementation violates one or more constraints identified in Section~\ref{subsec:constraints}.}
    \penaltyitem{18}{The other memory-mapped input/output functions' implementations violate one or more constraints identified in Section~\ref{subsec:constraints}.}
    \penaltyitem{17}{The simple system's implementation violates one or more constraints identified in Section~\ref{subsec:constraints}.}
